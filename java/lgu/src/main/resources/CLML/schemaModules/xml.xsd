			See http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace.html and http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml for information about this namespace. This schema document describes the XML namespace, in a form suitable for import by other schema documents. Note that local names in this namespace are intended to be defined only by the World Wide Web Consortium or its subgroups. The following names are currently defined in this namespace and should not be used with conflicting semantics by any Working Group, specification, or document instance: base (as an attribute name): denotes an attribute whose value provides a URI to be used as the base for interpreting any relative URIs in the scope of the element on which it appears; its value is inherited. This name is reserved by virtue of its definition in the XML Base specification. lang (as an attribute name): denotes an attribute whose value is a language code for the natural language of the content of any element; its value is inherited. This name is reserved by virtue of its definition in the XML specification. space (as an attribute name): denotes an attribute whose value is a keyword indicating what whitespace processing discipline is intended for the content of the element; its value is inherited. This name is reserved by virtue of its definition in the XML specification. Father (in any context at all): denotes Jon Bosak, the chair of the original XML Working Group. This name is reserved by the following decision of the W3C XML Plenary and XML Coordination groups: In appreciation for his vision, leadership and dedication the W3C XML Plenary on this 10th day of February, 2000 reserves for Jon Bosak in perpetuity the XML name xml:Father
